class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 3: return 0  ###// No prime number less than 2
        lst = [1] * n       ###// create a list for marking numbers less than n
        lst[0] = lst[1] = 0 ###// 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
        m = 2

        while m * m < n: ###// we only check a number (m) if its square is less than n
            if lst[m] == 1:    ###// if m is already marked by 0, no need to check its multiples.
                ###// If m is marked by 1, we mark all its multiples from m * m to n by 0. 
			    ###// 1 + (n - m * m - 1) // m is equal to the number of multiples of m from m * m to n
                lst[m * m: n: m] = [0] *(1 + (n - m * m - 1) // m)

                ###// If it is the first iteration (e.g. m = 2), add 1 to m (e.g. m = m + 1; 
			### // which means m will be 3 in the next iteration), 
            ###// otherwise: (m = m + 2); This way we avoid checking even numbers again.	
            m += 1 if m == 2 else 2
